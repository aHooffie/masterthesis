# masterthesis

This project shows several options:

First, open up Eclipse and carry out the following:
- import lang::crds::grammar; 
- import lang::crds::ast;

1) To parse a newly defined game and check for grammatical errors: # TODO: Check this.
- import lang::crds:: 

2) To perform a static analysis of the parsed rules: # TODO: Check this.
- import lang::crds::

3a) To play your own game of Hanabi: # TODO: Check this.
- import lang::crds::runhanabi;
- runGame(); # TODO: Update correct game as input

3b) To run an example game of Hanabi - output can be seen in exampleSimulation1:
- import lang::crds::runsimulation;
- runSimulation(int n);

4) To verify designer hypotheses of a game: # TODO: Check this.
- import lang::crds::checkhypotheses;
- runhypotheses(int n);
